# v0.2.0 Stable QA Gates and Exit Criteria

This document is the mandatory release gate for promoting from beta to stable `v0.2.0`.

## Release Candidate Metadata
- Candidate tag:
- Commit SHA:
- Tester(s):
- Date:
- Platform(s):
- Build command and artifact:

## Gate Rules
- Every **Must-Pass** scenario below must be executed and recorded.
- Any **critical** failure blocks stable promotion.
- Warnings are allowed only if documented in release notes under known limitations.
- Results must include links/paths to evidence (screenshots, logs, diagnostics zip).

## Must-Pass Scenarios

### 1. Clean Install First-Run
- [ ] Install fresh artifact on machine with no prior launcher data.
- [ ] App first launch completes without crash.
- [ ] Preflight checks run and render status in Install settings.
- [ ] Can create and launch one Fabric instance.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 2. Upgrade Path (Beta -> RC/Stable Candidate)
- [ ] Start from previous beta build.
- [ ] Update via in-app updater (same channel).
- [ ] App restarts into new version with settings and instances preserved.
- [ ] No data loss in instances/mods/packs/servers.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 3. Rollback Safety
- [ ] Trigger a rollback snapshot event (preset/mod/pack refresh flow).
- [ ] Introduce a reversible breaking change.
- [ ] Restore latest rollback snapshot successfully.
- [ ] Instance returns to pre-change working state.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 4. Instance Import/Export Round-Trip
- [ ] Export instance zip.
- [ ] Import into clean or secondary profile.
- [ ] Lockfile applies (if included) and artifacts resolve.
- [ ] Imported instance launches with expected mods/packs/settings.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 5. Server Profile Round-Trip
- [ ] Export server profile from configured instance.
- [ ] Import profile into another instance.
- [ ] Preferred server is set and reflected in UI.
- [ ] Profile-linked configuration and lockfile apply successfully.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 6. Offline and Failure Behavior
- [ ] Start launcher offline: UI remains usable and error messaging is actionable.
- [ ] Update check failure shows clear non-crashing status.
- [ ] Mod/pack refresh network failure is surfaced with actionable message.
- [ ] Lockfile drift reports missing artifacts/hash mismatch.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 7. Diagnostics Export Integrity
- [ ] Diagnostics export succeeds to zip.
- [ ] Zip includes expected metadata and recent logs.
- [ ] No account secrets/tokens present in exported contents.
- [ ] Diagnostic output is sufficient to triage a failed launch.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:

### 8. Update Channel Integrity
- [ ] Stable channel only targets stable release artifacts.
- [ ] Beta channel can see latest prerelease artifacts.
- [ ] Channel switch updates check behavior immediately.
- [ ] Missing/mismatched release assets are reported clearly.
- Evidence:
- Result:
- Notes:
